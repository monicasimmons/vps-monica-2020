I created this virtual pet shelter program to help a user navigate a visit to a pet shelter. First they have the option of choosing whether they are there to volunteer, adopt a pet, or admit a pet.

If they choose volunteer, they are then asked if they want to feed all pets, give water to all pets, or play with one pet. If they opt to feed or give water, they can then enter how much food or water to give them. If they choose to play with a pet, they can see all of the pets names and descriptions and decide which pet they want to play with.

If they choose adopt a pet, they can see all of the pets names and descriptions to decide which pet they want to adopt. One adopted, the pet is "removed" from the shelter.

If they choose admit a pet, they are prompted to enter pet name and description, then they are added to the shelter and assigned a random amount for food, water, and boredom levels, as someone might not know if they found a homeless pet.

With each loop, food and water level will will "tick down" (decrease) by 1 and boredom level will increase by 1.

If at any point, the user wants to quit, they just have to enter 4, and they can leave the game.
